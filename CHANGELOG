Version 0.4, August 1 2009
    - create plotter.py module with function, plot(), to plot a given
      observation for all satellites, outputting to given filename
      (extension determines format) (using matplotlib)
    - split gpsdata.iter() to gpsdata.iterdict() and gpsdata.iterlist()
    - eliminate gpsdata.iterepochs() in favor of gpsdata.iter('epoch')
    - create utility.py module for `useful' classes that didn't belong in
      gpsdata or readfile:  value, listvalue, fileread so far
      - This fixes a recursive dependency problem in `import readfile'
    - Comply PEP 8
      - Hence renamed package from GPSData to gpsdata
        - So main class is now gpsdata.gpsdata.GPSData
    - Count number of header sections in RINEX file
    - Track "phase connected arcs", ie periods between cycle slips, for
      each satellite.
      - New function in gpsdata.GPSData: breakphase, checkphase, sanearcs
    - RINEX: numrec in event flag 5 observation header indicates header lines
      following; process them.
      - since "epoch is significant" for flag 5, mark these header values
        with the epoch.
      - while I'm at it, mark all header values with the record number
      - and line number.
      - also mark records between flag 2 (start moving) and flag 3 (stop) as
        "in motion."
    - Correctly consume any PRN list continuation lines for event flag 6
      (which we ignore.)

Version 0.3.1, July 21 2009
    - fix operation for tarfiles (was using nonexistent next()):
      introduce readfile.fileread class to wrap various file-like objects
    - record.ptec(prn) returns (uncorrected, instantaneous, slant) phase TEC
      record.ctec(prn) returns uncorrected instantaneous slant code TEC
    - Include leap seconds, observation interval in header summary

Version 0.3, July 20 2009
    - don't crash on unknown format input files
    - output comments in header summary
    - fix bug in gpsdatetime vs. datetime equality comparison
    - check or supply leap seconds header info when a leap second occurs during
      the observations
    - nicer warning output
    - fix bug introduced since 0.2 in handling multiple files
    - Implement Compact RINEX processing in rinex.py, remove crx2rnx
      (eliminates platform dependency on Linux x86)
    - rename GPSData.rnx to GPSData.meta in lame attempt to appear less
      RINEX-dependent
    - forgive incorrect spacing in RINEX header labels
    - split out readfile.py, added support for multiple formats
      (currently only RINEX available)
    - determine interval of observations (for comparison with header)
    - GPSData.sats() returns set of satellite PRNs in this data
    - GPSData.iter() allows iteration over a given satellite, observation code,
      or both; GPSData.iterepochs() iterates over record epochs
    - fix gpsdatetime unpickling
    - friendlier error for nonexistent files
    - 2-digit years disambiguated correctly in absence of FIRST/LAST OBS
      (80-99 -> 1980-1999, 00-79 -> 2000-79)

Version 0.2, July 15 2009
    - use standard Python datetime for time data, not a home-grown struct
      - correctly deal with GPS, GLONASS (UTC), Galileo (TAI) time systems
      - include gpstime.py with useful time zones, leapseconds data
      - gpstime.gpsdatetime is a datetime class allowing utc offsets which are
        not whole minutes
      - 2-digit years disambiguated by TIME OF FIRST/LAST OBS
    - command-line call to rinex.py outputs header info
    - rinex.get_data() tracks some header stats and adds or verifies them

Version 0.1, July 13 2009
    - Initial release
