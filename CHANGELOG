Version 0.3, July 20 2009
    - don't crash on unknown format input files
    - output comments in header summary
    - fix bug in gpsdatetime vs. datetime equality comparison
    - check or supply leap seconds header info when a leap second occurs during
      the observations
    - nicer warning output
    - fix bug introduced since 0.2 in handling multiple files
    - Implement Compact RINEX processing in rinex.py, remove crx2rnx
      (eliminates platform dependency on Linux x86)
    - rename GPSData.rnx to GPSData.meta in lame attempt to appear less
      RINEX-dependent
    - forgive incorrect spacing in RINEX header labels
    - split out readfile.py, added support for multiple formats
      (currently only RINEX available)
    - determine interval of observations (for comparison with header)
    - GPSData.sats() returns set of satellite PRNs in this data
    - GPSData.iter() allows iteration over a given satellite, observation code,
      or both; GPSData.iterepochs() iterates over record epochs
    - fix gpsdatetime unpickling
    - friendlier error for nonexistent files
    - 2-digit years disambiguated correctly in absence of FIRST/LAST OBS
      (80-99 -> 1980-1999, 00-79 -> 2000-79)

Version 0.2, July 15 2009
    - use standard Python datetime for time data, not a home-grown struct
      - correctly deal with GPS, GLONASS (UTC), Galileo (TAI) time systems
      - include gpstime.py with useful time zones, leapseconds data
      - gpstime.gpsdatetime is a datetime class allowing utc offsets which are
        not whole minutes
      - 2-digit years disambiguated by TIME OF FIRST/LAST OBS
    - command-line call to rinex.py outputs header info
    - rinex.get_data() tracks some header stats and adds or verifies them

Version 0.1, July 13 2009
    - Initial release
