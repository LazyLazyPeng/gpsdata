The technique used by the receiver to measure the DPR dictates
the type of satellite timing biases that must be removed.

Receiver            DPR                 Satellite Bias
Ashtech Z-12        L2(P2) - L1(P1)     P1P2 bias
Ashtech Î¼Z-CGRS     L2(P2) - L1(P1)     P1P2 bias
NovAtel GSV 4004B   L2(P2) - L1(CA)     P1P2 bias minus the P1C1 bias

Files containing monthly estimates for the P1P2 and P1C1 biases can be
downloaded from http://www.aiub.unibe.ch/download/CODE/.

Calculate S4, ROTI, exclude data with S4 > 0.3 and ROTI > 10 TECU/min
from difference average
S4 = sqrt(<I^2> - <I>^2) / <I>, signal intensity std. dev / mean signal intensity

ROTI = rate of TEC change; TEC derivative?

curve coloring is by geomagnetic latitude?  (of the sat?)
to show "meridional gradients"


produce nightly receiver bias estimates by assuming from 3-5 am
vertical calibrated TEC from each satellite should be the same
choose rcvr bias which minimizes variance in this set

vertical cal TEC = [slant uncal TEC - (receiver bias + satellite bias)] / M(e, h)
where M(e,h) is the single layer mapping function

Keep 14 day average of estimated receiver bias to produce final calibrated
slant and vertical TEC; if TEC ever becomes negative, modify receiver bias
so that min TEC is 0.
